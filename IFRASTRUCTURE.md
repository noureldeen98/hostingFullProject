### Infrastructure

There are 3 services you need to list from AWS which are:
  - S3 bucket 
  - RDS which it is the database service.
  - Elasticbeans talk 
  - CircleCI since that is needed for the pipeline infrastructure 

 To enhance your performance you can download all the CLIs of the previose services to just write simple to command and apply what what you want.
